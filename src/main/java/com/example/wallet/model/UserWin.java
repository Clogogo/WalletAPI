/*
Called when the User wins (credit).
Operator is expected to increase player's balance by amount and return new balance.
reference_transaction_uuid show to which bet this win is related.
Each win has transaction_uuid which is unique identifier of this transaction.
Before any altering of User's balance, Operator has to check that win wasn't processed before.
Retry Policy: In case of network fail (HTTP 502, timeout, nxdomain, etc.)
we will retry 3 times with 1 sec of timeout. The rest of retry logic is left to providerâ€™s RGS: the retries may continue indefinitely or the bet may be rolled back, and the money returned back to user.
